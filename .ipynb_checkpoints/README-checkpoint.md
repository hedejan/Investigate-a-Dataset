# Investigate TMDb Movies Dataset
This was my second project at [Udacity](udacity.com) part of [Data Analysis Nano Degree (DAND)](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).
## Project Overview
In this project, I had to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it.
I used JupyterLab tool to run and import some of the most famous Python libraries in data analysis such as:
1- NumPy (for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices),
2- Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis),
3- Matplotlib (object-oriented API for embedding plots), and
4- Seaborn (data visualization library)
to help running this analysis and to visualize and present the outcomes.

## installation
It is recommended to install Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.

## Why this Project?
In this project, I had to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.
I have also learned how to use popular DA Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib, which are very effective and handy tools for any data analyst.

## What I have learned?
After completing the project, I have gained data investigation skills including the followings:

* Know the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that could be answered with a given dataset and try answering those questions
* learned the skills of **data wrangling** by cleaning, structuring and enriching raw data into a desired format for better decision making in less time.
* Communicated the results of the data analysis through different meaningful visualization through Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Utilized vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up the process of data analysis code execution
* Understood Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects to conveniently access and manipulate the dataset
